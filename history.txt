  2019-06-15: 20 images they should ahve same background.
  2019-06-16: The basic graphic design is done
              different crystals every game
              show my collections

  2019-06-17: remove reset.css as Zane suggested. No difference    
              Only collect the crystals when you wan the game.   
              Wait for 5 second before the new game started
